                    <p>The Tohoku region of Japan is home to unspoiled rural landscapes and historical treasures,
                        outdoor summer adventures and endless powder snow in the winter
                        Japan's northeastern wilderness is a huge region encompassing six rural prefectures, 
                        bound together by custom, heritage and recent tragedy. The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in
                        2011 brought out the resilient nature of Tohoku's people, and local passion and pride are putting the area
                        back on its feet. There's a lot to be proud of—dramatic landscapes, history-rich sites, craft sake and a
                        host of outdoor activities like rafting, hiking and skiing. Much more rural than Tokyo yet more developed
                         than Hokkaido, the Tohoku region makes for exciting excursions from the capital and memorable side trips 
                        on the journey to the northernmost region of Japan's main island.</p>
